    <h2>How to Bake a Cake</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and let it preheat while you prepare the cake batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine 1 ½ cups of all-purpose flour, 1 cup of sugar, ½ cup of softened butter, 2 large eggs, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 ½ teaspoons of baking powder, and ½ cup of milk. Mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Grease and Flour the Pan:</strong> Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter or non-stick spray, then lightly flour it to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour and Bake:</strong> Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting or serving.</li>
