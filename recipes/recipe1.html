    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups fresh or dried plums, pitted and chopped</li>
        <li>Optional: ¼ cup chopped walnuts or pecans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and allow it to preheat while you prepare the cake batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together ½ cup softened butter and 1 cup granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 large eggs one at a time, then stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 ½ cups flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon nutmeg, 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with ½ cup milk, until just combined. Fold in 1 ½ cups chopped plums and optional nuts.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pan:</strong> Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour and Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve as is or with a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
    </ol>    <br/>
